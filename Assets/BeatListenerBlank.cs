// This class is just an example of a beat listener. If you want to create one from scratch, copy-paste this.
// Then fill in whatever functionality you want to happen in the beat, by writing code in Trigger.
// Trigger is given a 'key' value which says which beat just happened. This is useful if you want multiple...
// ...beats to trigger the function in slightly different ways.
